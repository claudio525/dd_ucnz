    "\n",
    "- With so many moving and interacting parts, it is difficult to get a sense of which physics and parameters are controlling which outputs.\n",
    "- They typically have long execution times, which makes both *calibration* and *uncertainty quantification* difficult.\n",
    "- Some physics or parameters may have no impact on the result being modelled, i.e., more complexity has been included than is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommended approach is to *start simple*. Construct a model that has the simplest physics, the simplest geometry and the minimum number of parameters necessary to represent the problem. Once you have obtained a reasonable degree of understanding of this simple incarnation, $f_0(\\cdot)$, *one* additional element of complexity should be layered in. In this way, understanding of complex models is built “from the ground up” and we can avoid incorporating more complexity than is required to meet the modelling objectives.\n",

    "“*All models contain assumptions*” is about as useful an observation as “*water is wet*”. Properly stating and justifying the assumptions made in developing a model is a difficult but crucial aspect of reporting. Below are three key points to hit:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Is the assumption *relevant*?** A particular favourite in ENGSCI 111, when developing the model for a rock thrown in the air, is to state that “*we can assume relativistic effects are negligible*”. Great. While we’re at it, let’s assume we can ignore the rock’s flavour and that we’re probably not inhabiting some Matrix-type dream simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good test of whether or not an assumption is relevant, is to ask yourself: \n",
    "- “*Is this something that could go either way?*”\n",
    "- “*Might someone at first glance think ‘actually, that’s not a reasonable assumption’?*”\n",
    "- “*Did I put some modest amount of cognitive effort into deciding that ‘actually, this is a reasonable assumption to make’?*” \n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Is the assumption *justified*?** Imagine you write down an assumption of your model and I immediately shout “*that’s not true!*” If you can respond with “*yes, it is, and here’s why...*”, then this immediately serves as a basis for your justification. If you cannot respond, then you need to question the validity of that assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the following are *not* acceptable justifications for an assumption: \n",
    "- “*I need to assume this otherwise I cannot model the problem.*”\n",
    "- “*When I make this assumption, the model agrees with reality.*”\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) What are the *consequences* if the assumption is found to be unjustified?** This is challenging to address properly as, often, the only way to quantify the consequences is to run the same model with the assumption relaxed. As most assumptions amount to *leaving things out* of a model, relaxing an assumption implies adding complexity and all the additional effort that entails. Often it is only possible to describe in qualitative terms how model predictions might be affected by a particular assumption.\n"

    "The value of a model is not so much that it makes a prediction of the future, but rather it can make a range of predictions, attaching a probability to each. Thus, it is true to say that most model predictions contain some degree of uncertainty. The challenge then becomes: how do we identify the sources of uncertainty and then account for those properly when the model is used to make predictions? Later on in this course, you will encounter some techniques for uncertainty quantification. For now, it is enough to make some brief points about the communication of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- “From a range of possible outcomes, this is the outcome the model suggests is *most likely* to occur.”\n",

    "To minimize the potential for miscommunication (and to indemnify you against accusations of making misleading model predictions) it is good practice to accurately, and honestly, report sources of uncertainty associated with your model and any impact they may have on its specific predictions."
